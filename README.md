# spring-oauth-server-demo
A demo project for understanding Spring's oauth server. As of initial commit:
- It is Spring's OAuth server with minimal configurations.
- All the endpoints are secured, so if a user is **unauthenticated**, a login page will be shown asking user to authenticate.
- An authorization code can be generated by hitting the *authorize* endpoint.

### Endpoints:
Following endpoints could be used for specific purposes:
1. **Authorize endpoint:** http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=client&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https://google.com
2. **Well-Known endpoint:** http://localhost:8080/.well-known/openid-configuration

### Issue:
- Unable to get the access token using the generated auth code.
- Reason being we need to setup public-private key certificate pair in order for JWT to be generated(that's how JWT generation happens).
